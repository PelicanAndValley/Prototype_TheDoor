start_notes = PackedStringArray("Balloon Travel/Travel via balloon remains one of the sole methods of consistently accessing the box canyon, wherein sits The Door; a fact which I have found blastedly frustrating. I can navigate well enough, but sailing the skies is a skill they most certainly did not teach during my tenure at the academy. Thankfully, my classes have paid dividends, and I have been most successful in my journey through the sandstone canyons./Before our departure, Percy suggested an inappropriately rabelaisian appellation for this old girl, and heaven forgive me for saying such a thing, but I fear it\'s come to fit her. The device itself, a contraption I purchased from a Balloon Brother\'s front some weeks ago, has proved monstrously unreliable, often expending most of her lift not long after first ignition. This has led to my needing to leapfrog across the mountains, praying for thermals and gusts of wind to aim me along the correct path. Whilst I\'ve made progress, this dreadfully inefficient mode of transport has slowed progress to a snail\'s pace. I can only hope the canyon walls will protect me from these most frustrating zephyrs.", "Camp Established/I\'ve put together a small camp at the base of the canyon, which I rather suppose one might call the \'doorstep.\' I have supplies to last me perhaps two weeks, if I am careful. After this, I will need to consider returning to the village for additional supplies, or to surrender her mysteries to whoever will succeed me. I dearly hope I will be pushed to neither end.", "Sturdy Vines/The climate of this \'doorstep\' remains damnably humid, although this does provide a discrete advantage to the savvy explorer. All about the place, on trees, stones, and The Door itself, one can find a stunning variety of broad-leafed epiphytes, vines and ivies. Whilst these remain something of a nuisance to cut a path through, there seems to be a mature species, some sort of borogove I imagine, which provides strong purchase to any attempting to climb. Even I, unsteady as I am, have found it a task of some simplicity to clamber up the various rocky promontories about the place for my surveys. While I\'ve not yet dared to undertake such a task, I wonder if one could use these to ascend the rails of The Door itself.", "Reflections at the Doorstep/It remains a fascinating fact of human nature that our grandest mysteries become commonplace, over time. The Door has been a fixture of nearly every faith, cult, and folklore on this hemisphere. And yet, sitting beneath it, I feel flat. Small, yes, but utterly without the depth and vision so many have attributed to The Door./There are no buildings here, no masses of cults, or pilgrims to bow at it or inscribe it with wards and prayers. There are no grand naturalist inquiries which try to burrow around or below or through it. There is only me, only a lonely old man cooking hellfire stew in his pot, and the sound of a jubjub bird somewhere in the distance.", "Key Uncovered/I\'ve done it! The key is here! Damn my colleagues, the thing was lying just underfoot! There was a small earthen promontory not fifteen yards from the door itself, one which I found dreadfully curious, as its shape seemed at odds with the surrounding morass. After a short hour becoming increasingly familiar with my shovel, I found its head rattling against some monster shard of metal, I suspect some sort of bronze, or brass. (Alas, my studies in metallurgy at the academy were terribly lackluster. I\'ll have to have it examined at some later date.)/The whole beast is nearly thrice my own size, and must weigh enough to kill any man that might try and lift it. I\'ve no conception yet of how I might move the blasted thing, but in the meantime, I believe this calls for a celebration! Thank God I remembered to save that sherry for just such an occasion.", "Key Excavation Notes/Thank Heavens I remembered to bring my pulley set with me. I recall my colleagues thought the conveyance of such devices with me to be a daft expenditure of space, but how they thought to manipulate such equipment many times the size of mere men is beyond me. Perhaps they imagined themselves able to maneuver and utilize The Door by sheer force of will alone. It would hardly be the strangest departure from practicality I\'ve seen them take./By rigging the key to my pulley set, I was able to spend the afternoon hauling it from its resting place. The process was both exhausting and time-consuming, I don\'t suspect I should be able to replicate it, especially seeing as the damnable thing is still half-stuck in the ground./Still, I feel the effort was worth it in the end. The piece is fascinating! The metallurgic expenditure alone for this monster must have been enough to bankrupt a small town! At some point, I should make a more detailed examination of it, but for now, rest is calling me. I cannot imagine the tasks ahead should be simple.", "Reflections on Ambition/A curious thought struck me this evening as I sat about my fire. What if I were to open it? The Door has been such a fixture through time, its secrets have held millions in thrall. Were I to be the one to finally breach it, would I be lauded as a hero? Would they pin a medal on my chest, write my name in the history books? Or would I instead be considered arrogant? A fool who thought he might touch the divine, and so made it mundane by his actions?/The effort to maneuver the key to its lock would be staggering, let alone pushing open this behemoth. To do so alone would be almost unthinkable. And yet, I cannot shake the thought from my mind. I\'ll come to a decision in the morning, tonight, I must rest. My muscles ache something terrible.", "Stymied by Rain/Terrible rain this morning. I fear the autumnal monsoons might be arriving early this year, a fact that has most certainly dashed any hope I have of examining The Door from its rails; I was dizzy at the thought of needing to grapple up to the handles before, but climbing in such weather would be nigh on impossible for a young man, let alone someone of my age and corpulence. It would seem the good lord has decided for me: I should not be the one to open her, despite what ambitions I might have harbored last night./The battering my tent has received has been ferocious, sufficient to begin soaking through. Lest I choose to court illness, I believe I shall need to move camp. There was a rocky overhang, not overly distant from the promontory wherein I discovered the key. I should make for it, once the downpour begins to lessen.", "Camp Relocated/Although my shot at examining The Door from its rails has since past, I have found use for my pitons. Currently, they serve as pegs, by which my tent cloth now serves to block off the entrance to the overhang wherein I have relocated my encampment. The whole place has a quaint homeliness to it, such that I wonder why the local populace have chosen to avoid such places for the construction of their own homes. Perhaps seasonal flooding might preclude a long-term stay here?/I\'ve heard rumor of caves running through the cliff faces about The Door, but thus far I have seen none. Considering the nature of such tales, often involving foul monsters from beyond The Door, burrowing to the other side through shear stone, I consider such stories to be of dubious veracity. Still, I intend to keep my eyes open, if for geological study alone!", "Religious Site Examined/The rain has finally lessened, thank heavens, and I\'ve been able to step outside my little hovel and examine the surrounds of The Door more thoroughly. I encountered the most curious object as I did so: Some sort of shrine, surrounding which were a great number of flowers, of all shapes and sizes. In the center of this clearing was a platform, which I think might be a well-carved stump, upon which rests an axe of some quality./I have spent enough time in this locale to know some of the stories and legends the natives of this land hold fast to, but to my knowledge, none of them feature anything related to an axe, certainly not in any way that might relate to floriography. I will need to ask about this on my return voyage.", "Trouble with a Snake/It would seem my folly knows no bounds! This afternoon, I came upon a curious sight not fifty paces from my encampment. It would seem that some variety of serpent has taken up residence in a particularly gnarled little tree, overlooking the entrance to the overhang I have come to affectionately refer to as \'my hovel.\' I spent some minutes pouring through my herpetology texts in the hunt for a match, and whilst I was able to determine it to be some species of tropical mome rath, I\'ve been unable to narrow the hunt any further./Here is where my own ineptitude enters into the picture. I returned to my little hovel, and retrieved the grappling hook old Percy had gifted me some weeks back. One must understand, my purposes in this aim were dual: certainly, I hoped to dislodge the serpent from the tree, as I had hoped to examine it more closely, but should this fail, I hoped at least to dissuade it from making a nest so close to where I had established my privies, for fear that the thing might take a fancy to bothering me at my most private hours./I cast the hook up and onto the tree, and to my surprise, the beast took no interest in flight, but instead grappled onto the iron hook and wrenched it from my grip. Before I could regain control, it had pulled the whole affair into the branches with it, where it now sits, tangled and beyond my current reach. I shall need to find some other method by which I can retrieve it later.", "Tool Modifications/In attempting to rectify the mistakes of yesterday\'s encounter with the mome rath, I\'ve had to improvise. I\'ve taken one of my boat hooks and tied it to a tent pole, such that I can extend my reach some several feet. Hardly a professional affair, but hopefully this will help me disentangle that blasted grappling hook.", "Cave Hunting/I managed to uncoil some of the worst knots my serpentine friend left me with, but it as of yet remains thoroughly arboreal. Whilst I considered my predicament, I decided to go for a brisk walk and see about these rumors of caves leading to beyond the door. Whilst the canyon most certainly has a great number of convenient overhangs, I\'ve yet to discover anything resembling a deeper cave, a fact which has made me feel rather foolhardy for toting about the fire-lighter I purchased prior to the start of my voyage. Still, confirmation, even negative confirmation, is as valuable a tool in the scientific field as any gadget.", "Unstable Geology/This morning I woke to the sound of rumbling, and was shocked to find a small section of one of the canyon overhangs had collapsed. I\'ve heard tell that this whole region is prone to cave-ins, as the sandstone is eroded by regular flooding and rainfall, but this felt almost like an earthquake. It is my dearest hope that I should manage to complete my work withou-")
