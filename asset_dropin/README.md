# Asset Drop-in Folder

This folder is for dumping in raw assets, to be made ready for implementation.

When dumping a new asset here, some admin is required to track tasks. Trello has an Assets board: https://trello.com/invite/b/66bd68d3d5f1696d38cf89ce/ATTIe1aae2f53393f751d8f03f8ad804f64d952D6989/bsgj24-assets

Use the following rules for file management and Trello:

* Each asset, and all their related files, get one folder each.
* Most assets contribute to a larger goal. For example, a weapon for the player to use is contributing to the "player" goal.
* Determine the category of the asset within the task. In this example, a good category is "weapon".
* Determine also if this is a variant asset, for example this weapon could be a rusty variant of its normal counterpart.
* Use the following naming convention for the asset folder: GOAL_CATEGORY_ASSETNAME_VARIANT (delete any non applicable)
* Use a similar naming convention for a new Trello card in the Assets board. (doesnt have to be rigid, but it should be clear)
* Log assets as In Progress or Blocked as applicable
* When an asset is done and committed to the asset_dropin folder, and needing implementation, move it to the Dropped In column in Trello.

Us code monkeys (which are probably some of the same people) will take the task from there.
